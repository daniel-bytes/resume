# resume
My resume, in HTML format, with a homemade web server to host it

The server is a homemade HTTP server written in C++.  
This is obviously not a good idea for real production code, but it is fun to work on and serves as some example C++ code.

Compiles in Windows and Posix environments (with Scons build file available for non-Windows builds).  Visual Studio 2013 or GCC 4.7 (with c++11 flag) are required, as new C++11 features are used.
